# Dummy API

This REST API is a practice with GO Lang, it handles Items

## Item Structure

The Item structure is as follows:

```JSON
{
  "id": "1655570749194813500",
  "name": "Carrots",
  "quantity": 10
}
```

The id doesn't to be provided since It's generated by the API.

## Endpoints

List of available endpoints

- `GET` At `/items/list` Which provides a list of all the items in the API.
- `POST` At `/items/create` Which allows you to create a new item given that you send the correct [Item Structure](#item-structure) with the `content-type` as `application/json`.
- `GET` At `/items/:id` Which provides a single item from the list, where the param `:id` should be the Id of the Item. Example: `/items/1655570749194813500`.
- `GET` At `/items/random` Which redirects you to a random item from the list.
- `POST` At `/admin` Which will allow you acces only if passed the correct login info in the `Basic Auth` header.

## What I learned

First contact with the GO languge, discovered endpoint routing, data structs request reading and response writting with simple error handling.
